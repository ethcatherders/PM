## Preferred / Appropriate Channels of Communication

**Examples**:

* The best way to communicate regarding Ethereum announcements is using the [Ethereum Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org).
* The quickest way to communicate an issue or announcement is via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethereum) or the [Ethereum Cat Herders Medium](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders).
* [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org) - for discussion. It is a key source and hub for the discussion of major changes / process improvements happening within Ethereum for contributors (developers) and also an easy place to reference the conversation at a later date.
* [AllCoreDevs Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs) - Good for immediate response and discussion about emergency issues at hand as well as changes/improvements but has a limited user base (catered to core devs only and does not reach the broader community). 
* [Ethereum Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/) - A great resource for reaching active users and the broader community memebers within Ethereum.
