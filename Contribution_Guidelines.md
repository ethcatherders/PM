# Contribution Guidelines

Ethereum Cat Herders is a community-led project management group which aims to bring a fresh perspective to Ethereum blockchain and related projects to stay on schedule, improve productivity and quality of work. 

We invite all those who want to participate in the group to encourage consistent communications and help improve chances of achieving the desired result. 

## Recommendations 

1. **Join Ethereum-cat-herders community** on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum-cat-herders/community).  Engage in Gitter conversations. This is the best place to initiate a discussion. You may ask questions, communicate with group members who are currently involved in ECH tasks and seek for help. You may also share discussions at ECH [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumCatHerders/).
2. **Visit** ECH [**website**](http://www.ethereumcatherders.com) and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM). Although, GitHub seems to be more of a developers hangout place but we are using it for project management also.  
3. **View** [**ECH Tasks**](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/blob/master/ECHTaskList.md) - It may provide you a broader view of what we are currently working on.  You may also look into [open issues](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/issues), leave comments, or even assign to yourself if interested to work on it. 
4. Feel free to **fork our repos and create new PR** for any docs or process improvements. You may also review already submitted [PR](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/pulls)s and leave comments.
5. **Add agenda items and participate in bi-weekly calls**. Add agenda items, if anything you want to bring out for discussion. Agendas are posted [here](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/issues). You may follow live streaming at YouTube or be invited to join the call on Zoom (add agenda item to be discussed). Calling details are shared on Gitter. You may also participate and share your views on live chat during streaming.
