## Constantinople Post Mortem Report

### Background
Ethereum's planned upgrade Constantinople was postponed out of an abundance of caution, that would have occurred at block 7,080,000 on January 16, 2019. The decision was taken by key stake holders after they were made aware of the potential Constantinople-related issues identified by [ChainSecurity](https://medium.com/chainsecurity/constantinople-enables-new-reentrancy-attack-ace4088297d9) on January 15, 2019. As Ethereum Cat Herders, we decided to research and analyze what went wrong and how it could have been prevented. For sequence and details of the event, please read [A Post Mortem Report: The Constantinople Ethereum Hard Fork Postponement](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/a-post-mortem-report-the-constantinople-ethereum-hard-fork-postponement-dd780d7ae63d). 

### Purpose
The purpose of this report is to put process and best practices in place to be followed for future hardforks.

### Action Items
You may track the progress of Action Items (Constantinople Post Mortem) [here](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-cat-herders/projects/1) discussed in Ethereum Cat Herders meeting #4 [Notes](All%20Ethereum%20Cat%20Herder%20Meetings/Meeting%204.md). 

### Contributors
Various contributors to the Cat Herders are helping with their research. But to fascilitate the report, Ethereum Cat Herders have created a subcommitte, a team made up of people who are reliable and across multiple time zones, and are responsible for maintaining contact with the key stake holders.
