## 1. Hard Fork Coordination Update
The majority of the clients are now merged, including Pegasus and Trinity. In the process of bringing on a hard fork coordinator paid position. 

## 2. Updates on the action items from Constantinople post-mortem
This is mostly done. William Schwab says he doesn't done much on this for a long time and this may be a "zombie item" that should be taken off. We can put what we have in one of our repos, but we don't want to close the PR until this is off the list.

## 5. ProgPoW Findings
Released a [blog post](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/progpow-audits-released-ed4973ebe073) in multiple forums, including three different subReddits. First time we've been retweeted by the Ethereum foundation. 
Community has varied opinions on ProgPoW that are rising up again. Hudson senses there is a large segment of the community with objections to ProgPoW and wants to get an idea from the community how widespread it is. He wants to be able to pinpoint exactly what the issues are and how much support there is for them. He wants to find out what objections the community has and what the Core Devs should pay attention to. There was a discussion of previous attempts to capture this information, but there was no utility from any of these efforts.  

ProgPoW is not going to be decided on until after Istanbul. Want to make sure that all the funding for ProgPoW will be paid out to Least Authority. Hudson will be taking care of this. 

Brent Allsop proposed the possibility of Canonizer as a tool to find out concisely what everyone's concerns are regarding ProgPoW and briefly described Canonizer's ability to find out concisely and quantitatively what everyone thinks. He pointed out that in the [Canonizer Ethereum Consensus Project](https://canonizer.com/topic/210-Ethereum-Consensus-Project/1) there is already a [ProgPoW topic.](https://canonizer.com/topic/211-Programmatic-Proof-of-Work/1) Canonizer is a tool that can help build consensus around ProgPoW and how to get it implemented while allowing anyone with any concerns to have their voice be heard concisely and quantitatively.  

Hudson Jameson was open to using Canonizer to try to build consensus around ProgPoW and how to release it.
